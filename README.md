[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SingingBush/eloquent.png)](https://travis-ci.org/SingingBush/eloquent)

Eloquent is a lightweight web application written in D.

[Vibe.d](http://vibed.org) is the main dependency.

## Yet to implement
 - error handling (exceptions should result in a readable error page)
 - database persistence (will likely use mysql driver and hibernated)
 - internationalisation
 - automated builds
